# EDA-on-SuicideRates
In this Exploratory Data Analysis, I utilized datasets sourced from the United Nations Development Program, World Health Organization, Kaggle, and the World Bank.
The data spans from 1985 to 2016 and focuses on suicide rates. In today's fast-paced and ever-evolving environment, individuals frequently encounter situations where
they may make missteps. This analysis serves as a valuable resource for establishing suicide prevention centers. By leveraging the insights gleaned, these centers can
provide effective consultation and support to individuals grappling with challenges.
